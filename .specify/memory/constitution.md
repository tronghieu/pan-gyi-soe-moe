## Core Principles

### Code Quality Standards
All code must adhere to established style guides and pass linting; Static analysis tools required; Code complexity metrics must be maintained below thresholds; Documentation required for all public interfaces.

### Testing Standards
Unit tests for critical functionality where needed; Focus on manual testing for user-facing features; Automated tests only for complex logic or business-critical functions; Tests must pass before merging.

### User Experience Consistency
Consistent UI/UX patterns across the application; Follow design system guidelines; Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) required; Responsive design for all screen sizes.

### Performance Requirements
Page load times under 3 seconds; Core Web Vitals must meet good thresholds; Optimized bundle sizes; Efficient database queries and API responses.

### Security and Privacy
Secure coding practices; Data protection compliance; Regular security audits; Input validation and sanitization.

## Development Workflow

Self-review of changes; Basic automated checks; Simple versioning; Deploy changes directly for personal website updates.

## Quality Assurance

Code reviews mandatory; Manual testing for user-facing features; Performance monitoring; Bug tracking and resolution process.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes other practices; Amendments require team consensus; Regular compliance reviews; Team responsible for enforcement.
