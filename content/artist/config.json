  "artistStatement": "My work explores the delicate balance between tradition and modernity in Myanmar's cultural landscape. Through contemporary abstract expressionism infused with traditional motifs, I seek to create visual experiences that honor our ancestors while speaking to present and future generations.\n\nEach piece is a meditation on memory, place, and identity. I am particularly drawn to the architectural beauty of Myanmar's temples, the vibrant patterns of traditional textiles, and the stories embedded in our cultural practices. My goal is to translate these elements into a visual language that transcends cultural boundaries while remaining deeply rooted in Myanmar's artistic heritage.",
