description: "'Azure Dreamscape' captures the ethereal quality of a daydream rendered in vivid blues and complementary accents. The piece features fluid, organic forms that seem to float and merge within the composition, creating a sense of peaceful otherworldly beauty.\n\nThe artwork explores the boundary between consciousness and the dream state, using the color blue to represent the vastness of the mind's potential. Gentle gradations and soft edges invite contemplation and introspection.\n\nVance employed a mixed technique of traditional brushwork combined with palette knife applications to create varied textures that add depth and visual interest to the predominantly blue palette."
