description: "A magnificent photograph by Nguyen Vinh Hien showcasing Vietnam's iconic Golden Bridge (Cau Vang) in Da
Nang. This architectural marvel, held aloft by giant stone hands, has become a symbol of Vietnam's bold contemporary
design and its ability to create structures that honor both tradition and innovation.

The photograph captures the bridge's dramatic setting amidst the Ba Na Hills, with its golden walkway seeming to float
above the clouds. The composition emphasizes the surreal quality of the architecture and its harmonious integration with
the mountainous landscape.

Hien's work celebrates Vietnam's emergence as a destination for innovative architecture while respecting the natural
beauty of the land. The title references Vietnam's ancient name and cultural identity, connecting modern achievement
with historical pride."
