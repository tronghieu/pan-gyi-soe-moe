description: "'Volcanic Flow' represents Vance's exploration of natural forces and the raw power of geological processes. Using predominantly red and black tones, the piece captures the fluid, destructive, and creative nature of lava flows.\n\nThe composition features dynamic, sweeping gestures that suggest the movement of molten rock across a landscape. The rich textures created through mixed media applications add a tactile quality that emphasizes the physical nature of the subject matter.\n\nThis piece demonstrates Vance's technique of building up layers of material to create depth and complexity, mirroring the geological processes that form our planet's surface over millennia."
