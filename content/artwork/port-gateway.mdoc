description: "A striking photograph by Vu Van Lam documenting a historic gateway in a Vietnamese port city. This image
captures the architectural heritage that marks the entrance to traditional urban quarters, serving as both functional
infrastructure and symbolic threshold.

The composition emphasizes the gateway's architectural details, weathered by time yet still standing as a testament to
the city's maritime history. The photograph documents how these structures serve as physical markers of cultural
identity and historical continuity.

Lam's work preserves the memory of Vietnam's port cities and their role in trade, cultural exchange, and national
development. The image invites reflection on how architectural heritage anchors community identity and connects present
generations to their historical roots."
