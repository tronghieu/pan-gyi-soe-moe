description: "'Cosmic Echo' is an exploration of the universe's silent symphony, a visual representation of the vibrations that connect all things. This piece delves into the profound beauty found in celestial chaos, capturing the fleeting moments of creation and destruction within the vast expanse of space. It's a meditation on our place within the cosmos, inviting the viewer to contemplate the infinite.\n\nThe composition features swirling patterns of blue, gold, and deep purple, resembling a nebula in space. The layering of colors creates a sense of depth and movement, as if the viewer is looking into the heart of a distant galaxy.\n\nThis work represents Vance's continued exploration of cosmic themes, using her signature technique of blending colors directly on the canvas to create organic transitions that mirror the natural processes of the universe."
