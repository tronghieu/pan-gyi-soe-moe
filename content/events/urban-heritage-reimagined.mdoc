description: "A contemporary art exhibition exploring the intersection of traditional Vietnamese architecture and modern
urban development. This thought-provoking show features works by emerging artists who challenge viewers to reconsider
the role of cultural heritage in rapidly modernizing cities.

The exhibition presents diverse artistic interpretations of iconic Vietnamese architectural elements - from French
colonial buildings to traditional tube houses - and examines how these structures shape urban identity and collective
memory.

Through painting, photography, sculpture, and digital media, artists explore themes of preservation, transformation, and
the tension between progress and tradition. The works invite dialogue about sustainable urban development that honors
cultural heritage while embracing innovation.

Join us for panel discussions with urban planners, architects, and cultural preservationists throughout the exhibition
period."
