description: "A special exhibition featuring the works of Bui Viet Duc, exploring the spiritual and cultural awakening
of Vietnam's highland regions. This exhibition presents a powerful collection of photographs and mixed media works that
capture the essence of highland communities and their deep connection to the land.

Through Duc's lens, viewers will experience the misty mountains, terraced rice fields, and vibrant ethnic minority
cultures that define Vietnam's highland regions. Each piece reflects the artist's profound respect for traditional ways
of life and the resilience of highland communities.

The exhibition includes documentary photography, artistic interpretations, and personal narratives from highland
residents, creating a multifaceted exploration of cultural identity and environmental stewardship.

Special programming includes artist talks, traditional music performances, and workshops on highland cultural
practices."
